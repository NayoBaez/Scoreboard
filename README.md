# SCOREBOARD

I built this game score tracker from scratch as part of a scribe challenge. I was given the task to create this solo project based on a Figma design, although the stretch challenge was to personalise the design which I did. The app relies on DOM manipulation to track the game score and resets each counter individually but also resets the whole game, when pressing on the new game button.
